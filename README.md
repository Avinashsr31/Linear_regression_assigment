Bike sharing assignment
> Outline a brief description of your project.
A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

## General Information
- Build a linear regression model to find the variables which have a significant impact on the demand for shared bikes.
- What is the background of your project?
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?:  variables that affect the demand for shared bikes and the extent of their impacy
- What is the dataset that is being used?

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
1) The temperature or weather conditions form a weightage nearly 66% (temp+Summer+Winter+clear_partlycloudy)as the cause of more demand, here it is not clear as to why the weather condition "Spring" has a negative correlation with the target variable

2) The variable "yr" has a weightage of nearly 24% for increase in bike demand
